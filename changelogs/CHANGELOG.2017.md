    - Updated the New-GMLGameSessionQueue and Update-GMLGameSessionQueue cmdlets with a new parameter, -PlayerLatencyPolicy, to enable developers to specify a maximum allowable latency per queue.
  * AWS OpsWorks
    - Updated the New-OPSLayer and Update-OPSLayer cmdlets with new parameters -CloudWatchLogsConfiguration_Enabled and -CloudWatchLogsConfiguration_LogStream to attaching a Cloudwatch Logs agent configuration to OpsWorks Layers. OpsWorks will then automatically install and manage the CloudWatch Logs agent on the instances that are part of the OpsWorks Layer.

### 3.3.75.0 (2017-04-10)
  * Fixed issue with cmdlets taking a long time to return when no region was specified.
  * Fixed issue with the argument completer for the -ProfileName parameter issuing a warning message about use of a deprecated switch on the Get-AWSCredentials cmdlet.
  * Amazon Redshift
    - Added a new cmdlet, Get-RSClusterCredential, to support the new GetClusterCredentials API.

### 3.3.74.0 (2017-04-07)
  * AWS CloudWatch
    - Updated the Write-CWMetricAlarm cmdlet with support for new alarm configurations for missing data treatment and percentile metrics. Missing data can now be treated as alarm threshold breached, alarm threshold not breached, maintain alarm state and the current default treatment. Percentile metric alarms are for alarms that can trigger unnecessarily if the percentile is calculated from a small number of samples. The new rule can treat percentiles with low sample counts as same as missing data. If the first rule is enabled, the same treatment will be applied when an alarm encounters a percentile with low sample counts.
  * Amazon ElastiCacheElastiCache
    - Added support for testing the Elasticache Multi-AZ feature with Automatic Failover. This support includes a new parameter, -NodeGroupId, for the Edit-ECReplicationGroup cmdlet and -ShowCacheClustersNotInReplicationGroup added to Get-ECCacheCluster and a new cmdlet, Test-ECFailover (TestFailover API).
  * Amazon Lex
    - Added a new cmdlet, Send-LEXContent, to support the new PostContent API.

### 3.3.71.0 (2017-03-31)
  * AWS Resource Groups Tagging API
    - Added support for the new Resource Groups Tagging API service. Cmdlets for the service have the noun prefix 'RGT' and can be listed using the command 'Get-AWSCmdletName -Service RGT': Add-RGTResourceTag (TagResources API), Get-RGTResource (GetResources API), Get-RGTTagKey (GetTagKeys API), Get-RGTTagValue (GetTagValues API) and Remove-RGTResourceTag (UntagResources API).
  * AWS Storage Gateway
    - Added a new cmdlet, Invoke-CacheRefresh (RefreshCache API), and extended the New-SGNFSFileShare and Update-SGNFSFileShare cmdlets with new parameters -ReadOnly and -Squash.
  * Amazon Cloud Directory
    - Updated the Get-CDIRObjectAttribute cmdlet with two new parameters, -FacetFilter_FacetName and -FacetFilter_SchemaArn, to support the new service feature enabling filtering by facet.

### 3.3.69.0 (2017-03-29)
  * AWS Batch
    - Added parameters to support specifying retry strategy for the Register-BATJobDefinition and Submit-BATJob cmdlets. The parameter, -RetryStrategy_Attempt, accepts a numeric value for attempts. This is the number of non successful executions before a job is considered FAILED. In addition, the JobDetail object returned by other cmdlets now has an attempts field and shows all execution attempts.
  * Amazon EC2
    - Added support for tagging Amazon EC2 Instances and Amazon EBS Volumes at the time of their creation with the addition of a parameter, -TagSpecification, to the New-EC2Volume and New-EC2Instance cmdlets. By tagging resources at the time of creation, you can eliminate the need to run custom tagging scripts after resource creation. In addition, you can now set resource-level permissions on the CreateVolume, CreateTags, DeleteTags, and the RunInstances APIs. This allows you to implement stronger security policies by giving you more granular control over which users and groups have access to these APIs. You can also enforce the use of tagging and control what tag keys and values are set on your resources. When you combine tag usage and resource-level IAM policies together, you can ensure your instances and volumes are properly secured upon creation and achieve more accurate cost allocation reporting. These new features are provided at no additional cost.
  * Added the legacy alias Get-SSMParameterNameList (an alias for Get-SSMParameterValue) to the AliasesToExport collection in the module manifest so that the alias is available without needing to explicitly import the module.

### 3.3.67.0 (2017-03-24)
  * AWS Application Discovery Service
    - Added two new cmdlets Get-ADSExportTask (DescribeExportTasks API) and Start-ADSExportTask (StartExportTask API) to support the new service feature for exporting configuration options.
  * AWS Lambda
    - Added argument completion support for the new Node.js v6.10 runtime option.

### 3.3.65.0 (2017-03-21)
  * Amazon S3
    - Fixed issue with the Write-S3Object cmdlet reporting error "The difference between the request time and the current time is too large" when uploading very large (> 100GB) files.
  * Amazon Pinpoint
    - Added cmdlets Get-PINEventStream (GetEventStream API), Remove-PINEventStream (DeleteEventStream API) and Write-PINEventStream (PutEventStream API) to support publishing of raw app analytics and campaign events data as events streams to Kinesis and Kinesis Firehose. The Update-PINSegment and New-PINSegment cmdlets were updated with a new parameter, -Dimensions_UserAttribute, to support the ability to segment endpoints by user attributes in addition to endpoint attributes.
  * All cmdlet names are now enumerated into the module manifest enabling tab-completion of command names without needing to explicitly import the module into the environment.

### 3.3.64.2 (2017-03-17)
  * Fixed issue with Initialize-AWSDefaults reporting 'source profile not found' error when run to load credentials from the 'default' profile.

### 3.3.64.1 (2017-03-15)
  * Added support for reading and writing credential profiles to both the AWS .NET SDK encrypted credential store and the shared credential store used by other AWS SDKs and tools. Previously credentials could only be read from both stores, and written to only the SDK's encrypted store.
  * Added support for new credential profile types supporting cross-account IAM roles (aka 'assume role' profiles) and credentials requiring use of an MFA. For more details on the updated credential support see the blog post announcing the update at https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-sdk-dot-net-credential-profiles/ and the credential setup topics in the user guide at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-getting-started.html.
  * AWS Device Farm
    - Added support for network shaping. Network shaping allows users to simulate network connections and conditions while testing their Android, iOS, and web apps with AWS Device Farm. The update includes new cmdlets Get-DFNetworkProfile (GetNetworkProfile API), Get-DFNetworkProfileList (ListNetworkProfiles API), New-DFNetworkProfile (CreateNetworkProfile API), Remove-DFNetworkProfile (DeleteNetworkProfile API) and Update-DFNetworkProfile (UpdateNetworkProfile API).

### 3.3.62.0 (2017-03-13)
  * Fixed issue with Set-AWSSamlRoleProfile incorrectly formatting user identities specified in email format. The identity was being stored in the role profile with as \email@domain.com (domain\userid format) but with empty domain. The leading \ then had to be removed by the user each time a password demand was issued.
  * Amazon Relation Database Service
    - Updated the Copy-RDSDBClusterSnapshot and New-RDSDBCluster cmdlets to add support for using encrypted clusters as cross-region replication masters and encrypted cross region copy of Aurora cluster snapshots.
  * Amazon Simple Systems Management
    - Added help examples for all SSM cmdlets.
  * Amazon WorkDocs
    - Added support for the Amazon WorkDocs service. The Amazon WorkDocs SDK provides full administrator level access to WorkDocs site resources, allowing developers to integrate their applications to manage WorkDocs users, content and permissions programmatically. Cmd;lets for this service have the noun prefix 'WD' and can be listed using the command 'Get-AWSCmdletName -Service WD'.
  * AWS Organizations
    - *Breaking Change*
    Updated cmdlets to fix an issue with the wrong service model version being used. This may be a breaking change for some users. The Enable-ORGFullControl cmdlet has been removed, and the Enable-ORGAllFeatures cmdlet added in the corrected.
  * Amazon Cloud Directory
    - Added a new cmdlet, Get-CDIRObjectParentPath, to enable retrieval of all available parent paths for any type of object (a node, leaf node, policy node, and index node) in a hierarchy.
  * Amazon API Gateway
    - Updated the New-AGDomainName cmdlet to add support for ACM certificates on custom domain names. Both Amazon-issued certificates and uploaded third-part certificates are supported.
  * Amazon Elastic MapReduce
    - Added support for instance fleets with new cmdlets Add-EMRInstanceFleet (AddInstanceFleet API), Edit-EMRInstanceFleet (ModifyInstanceFleet API) and Get-EMRInstanceFleets (ListInstanceFleets API).

### 3.3.58.0 (2017-03-06)
  * Amazon EC2
    - Added two new keys, WINDOWS_2016_CORE and WINDOWS_2012R2_CORE, to the Get-EC2ImageByName cmdlet, to support retrieving the latest Windows Server 2016 Core and Windows Server 2012R2 Core AMIs.
  * AWS OpsWorks
    - OpsWorks for Chef Automate has added a new field "AssociatePublicIpAddress" to the New-OWCMServer cmdlet, "CloudFormationStackArn" to the Server model and "TERMINATED" server state.

### 3.3.57.0 (2017-02-27)
  * AWS Organizations
    - Added support for the new AWS Organizations service. AWS Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple AWS accounts into an organization and centrally manage your accounts and their resources. Cmdlets for this service have the noun prefix ORG and can be listed using the command Get-AWSCmdletName -Service ORG.
  * Amazon MTurk Service
    - Added support for Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a web service that provides an on-demand, scalable, human workforce to complete jobs that humans can do better than computers, for example, recognizing objects in photos. Cmdlets for this service have the noun prefix MTR and can be listed using the command Get-AWSCmdletName -Service MTR.
  * Amazon Elasticsearch
    - Added three cmdlets to support new APIs for exposing limits imposed by Elasticsearch. The new cmdlets are Get-ESInstanceTypeLimit (DescribeElasticsearchInstanceTypeLimits API), Get-ESInstanceTypeList (ListElasticsearchInstanceTypes API) and Get-ESVersionList (ListElasticsearchVersions API).
  * Amazon DynamoDB
    - Added two new cmdlets to support the new 'Time to Live' APIs. The new cmdlets are Get-DDBTimeToLive (DescribeTimeToLive API) and Update-DDBTimeToLive (UpdateTimeToLive API).

### 3.3.56.0 (2017-02-23)
  * Fixed issue with the Set-AWSSamlRoleProfile cmdlet reporting a null reference exception.
  * (NetCore module only) Fixed issue with cmdlet help not being available due to a misnamed help file.
  * Amazon EC2
    - Added -InstanceType completion support for the new I3 instance type.

### 3.3.55.0 (2017-02-22)
  * Amazon EC2
    - Updated the Register-EC2Image cmdlet with a new parameter, -BillingProduct.
  * Amazon GameLift
    - Added cmdlet support for the new service feature enabling developers to configure global queues for creating GameSessions and to allow PlayerData on PlayerSessions to store player-specific data.
  * AWS Elastic Beanstalk
    - Added support for creating and managing custom platforms with environments.
    - *Breaking Change*
      The update for custom platform support changed the service response data for the DescribeConfigurationOptions API (Get-EBConfigurationOption cmdlet) to include an additional field, PlatformArn. Previously the cmdlet was able to pipe the configuration options collection to the pipeline. In this release the output from the cmdlet has changed so that the entire service response data (Amazon.ElasticBeanstalk.Model.DescribeConfigurationOptionsResponse) is emitted to the pipeline, not the collection of configuration options. To obtain the previous behavior, add a select clause to your code, for example: 'Get-EBConfigurationOption ...parameters... | select -expandproperty Options | ...'.

### 3.3.53.1 (2017-02-20)
  * Fixed bug in Get-AWSCredentials. When the -ListProfiles switch was used the collection of profile names was not correctly enumerated to the pipeline.

### 3.3.53.0 (2017-02-17)
  * AWS Direct Connect
    - Added cmdlet support for the new ability for Direct Connect customers to take advantage of Link Aggregation (LAG). This allows you to bundle many individual physical interfaces into a single logical interface, referred to as a LAG. This makes administration much simpler as the majority of configuration is done on the LAG while you are free to add or remove physical interfaces from the bundle as bandwidth demand increases or decreases. A concrete example of the simplification added by LAG is that customers need only a single BGP session as opposed to one session per physical connection.

### 3.3.52.0 (2017-02-16)
  * This version was only distributed in the downloadable AWS Tools for Windows msi installer.
  * AWS Config
    - Updated the Write-CFGEvaluations cmdlet with a new parameter, -TestMode. Set the TestMode parameter to true in your custom rule to verify whether your AWS Lambda function will deliver evaluation results to AWS Config. No updates occur to your existing evaluations, and evaluation results are not sent to AWS Config.

### 3.3.51.0 (2017-02-15)
  * Amazon EC2
    - Added cmdlet support for the new Modify Volumes APIs. This includes two new cmdlets, Edit-EC2Volume (ModifyVolume API) and Get-EC2VolumeModification (DescribeVolumesModification API).
  * AWS Key Management Service
    - Added support for the new tagging apis with three new cmdlets: Add-KMSResourceTag (TagResource API), Get-KMSResourceTag (ListResourceTags API) and Remove-KMSResourceTag (UntagResource API). The New-KMSKey cmdlet was also extended to support a -Tag parameter.
  * AWS Storage Gateway
    - Updated the New-SGNFSFileShare and Update-SGNFSFileShare cmdlets to support acess to objects in S3 as files on a Network File System (NFS) mount point. Customers can restrict the clients that have read/write access to the gateway by specifying the list of clients as a list of IP addresses or CIDR blocks to the new -ClientList parameter on these cmdlets.

### 3.3.48.0 (2017-02-09)
  * Amazon EC2
    - Fixed issue with the Get-EC2Instance cmdlet not accepting instance IDs that were supplied as PSObject types. The cast to string on the supplied PSObject(s) failed, resulting in the cmdlet listing all instances on output, not the requested instances.
    - Added support for a new feature enabling users to associate an IAM profile with running instances that were not launched with a profile. The new cmdlets are Get-EC2IamInstanceProfileAssociation (DescribeIamInstanceProfileAssociations API), Register-EC2IamInstanceProfile (AssociateIamInstanceProfile API), Set-EC2IamInstanceProfileAssociation (ReplaceIamInstanceProfileAssociation API) and Unregister-EC2IamInstanceProfileAssociation (DisassociateIamInstanceProfileAssociation API).

### 3.3.47.0
  * This build was not released.

### 3.3.46.0 (2017-02-07)
  * Fixed issue with the Get-AWSCredentials cmdlet reporting a 'could not find part of path' error attempting to access the %userprofile%\.aws folder (default folder of the shared credentials file) when run on systems where the shared credential file was not in use and the folder did not exist. The cmdlet should instead have tested for folder existence and silently skipped over it when not present.
  * Fixed issue with using SAML credential profiles in regions where a region-specific Security Token Service endpoint is required, eg China (Beijing). After successfully authenticating with the ADFS endpoint the tools request temporary credentials from STS and this call was always directed against the global sts.amazonaws.com endpoint, not the regional endpoint, thus failing to obtain credentials. To enable SAML role profiles to specify that a regional endpoint must be used, the Set-AWSSAMLRoleProfile cmdlet has been extended with a new parameter, -STSEndpointRegion, that can be used to specify the region system name (eg -STSEndpointRegion cn-north-1), resulting in the correct STS endpoint being used to obtain credentials.
  * Amazon Lex
    - Added support for the new Amazon Lex service, for building conversational interactions into any application using voice or text. Cmdlets for this service have the noun prefix 'LEX' and can be viewed using the command 'Get-AWSCmdletName -Service LEX'. Currently the service contains a single cmdlet, Send-LEXText, corresponding to the service's PostText API.

### 3.3.45.0 (2017-01-26)
  * Amazon Cloud Directory
    - Added support for the new Amazon Cloud Directory service, a highly scalable, high performance, multi-tenant directory service in the cloud. Its web-based directories make it easy for you to organize and manage application resources such as users, groups, locations, devices, policies, and the rich relationships between them. Cmdlets for this service have the noun prefix 'CDIR' and can be viewed using the command 'Get-AWSCmdletName -Service CDIR'.
  * AWS CodeDeploy
    - Updated cmdlets to support the new service feature enabling blue/green deployments. In a blue/green deployment, the current set of instances in a deployment group is replaced by new instances that have the latest application revision installed on them. After traffic is rerouted behind a load balancer to the replacement instances, the original instances can be terminated automatically or kept running for other uses. In addition to additional parameters on existing cmdlets, two new cmdlets were added: Resume-CDDeployment (ContinueDeployment API) and Skip-CDWaitTimeForInstanceTermination (SkipWaitTimeForInstanceTermination API).
  * Amazon EC2
    - Updated the Request-EC2SpotFleet cmdlet with a new parameter, -SpotFleetRequestConfig_ReplaceUnhealthyInstance, to support instance health check functionality to replace EC2 spot fleet instances with new ones.
  * Amazon Relational Database Service
    - Updated cmdlets to support the new Snapshot Engine version upgrade. This update includes a new cmdlet, Edit-RDSDBSnapshot, mapped to the ModifyDBSnapshot API.

### 3.3.44.0 (2017-01-25)
  * Amazon WorkSpaces
    - *Breaking Change* Fixed issue with incorrect mapping of Stop-WKSWorkspace to the TerminateWorkspaces API, which could cause data loss if termination was not expected. A new cmdlet, Remove-WKSWorkspace, has been added which maps to the TerminateWorkspaces API. Stop-WKSWorkspace has been mapped to the StopWorkspaces API and the existing -Request parameter changed to accept types of Amazon.Workspaces.Model.StopRequest (previously it accepted Amazon.Workspaces.Model.TerminateRequest). For users employing New-Object to construct the parameters, this is a breaking change (customers known to have used this cmdlet in the past few months have been contacted about this change).
    - In addition to introducing a new cmdlet and correcting the mapping we have also taken steps to improve the usability of the cmdlets related to manipulating workspaces (Start-WKSWorkspace, Stop-WKSWorkspace, Remove-WKSWorkspace, Reset-WKSWorkspace and Rebuild-WKSWorkspace). These cmdlets all now support an additional –WorkspaceId parameter. This parameter accepts an array of strings that are the IDs of the workspaces to operate on, improving pipeline usability. Examples have been added to the cmdlet help to show the new simplified usages.
  * Elastic Load Balancing V2
    - Application Load Balancers now support native Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). With this ability, clients can now connect to the Application Load Balancer in a dual-stack mode via either IPv4 or IPv6. The New-ELB2LoadBalancer was extended with a new parameter, -IpAddressType, to support this new feature and one new cmdlet was added, Set-ELB2IpAddressType (SetIpAddressType API).
  * Amazon Relational Database Service
    - Extended the New-RDSDBInstanceReadReplica cmdlet with parameters -KmsKeyId. -PresignedUrl and -SourceRegion to support cross-region read replica copying.

### 3.3.43.0 (2017-01-24)
  * AWS CodeCommit
    - Added new cmdlets Get-CCBlob (GetBlob API) and Get-CCDifferenceList (GetDifferences API) to support the new service feature for viewing differences between commits. The existing Get-CCBranchList and get-CCRepositoryList cmdlets have also been extended to support automatic pagination of all results now that it is supported on these API calls by the service.
  * Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS)
    - Added a new cmdlet, Update-ECSContainerInstancesState (UpdateContainerInstancesState API) to support the new service feature enabling state for container instances that can be used to drain a container instance in preparation for maintenance or cluster scale down.

### 3.3.42.0 (2017-01-20)

  * This version was only distributed in the downloadable AWS Tools for Windows msi installer.
  * Amazon EC2
    - Extended the Request-EC2SpotInstance cmdlet with a new parameter, Placement_Tenacy, to support the new service feature for dedicated tenancy, providing the ability to run Spot instances single-tenant manner on physically isolated hardware within a VPC to satisfy security, privacy, or other compliance requirements. Dedicated Spot instances can be requested using RequestSpotInstances and RequestSpotFleet.
  * AWS Health
    - Updated the parameter documentation for several cmdlets to match latest service documentation updates.

### 3.3.40.0 (2017-01-18)
  * This release contained only changes in the underlying AWS SDK for .NET and was not published to the gallery.

### 3.3.39.0 (2017-01-17)
  * Amazon DynamoDB
    - Added support for the new APIs to tag tables and indexes with three new cmdlets: Add-DDBResourceTag (TagResource API), Get-DDBResourceTag (ListTagsOfResource API) and Remove-DDBResourceTag (UntagResource API).

### 3.3.38.0 (2017-01-16)
  * AWS Cost and Usage Report
    - Added support for the new AWS Cost and Usage Report service. This service API allows you to enable and disable the Cost & Usage report, as well as modify the report name, the data granularity, and the delivery preferences. Cmdlets for this service have the noun prefix 'CUR' and can be viewed by running the command 'Get-AWSCmdletName -Service CUR'.

### 3.3.37.2 (2017-01-12)
  * Amazon EC2
    - Added new keys to the Get-EC2ImageByName cmdlet to support querying for Windows Server 2012R2 images with SQL Server 2016.

### 3.3.37.1 (2017-01-09)
  * AWS Health
    - Added support for the AWS Health service. The AWS Health API serves as the primary source for you to receive personalized information related to your AWS infrastructure, guiding your through scheduled changes, and accelerating the troubleshooting of issues impacting your AWS resources and accounts. Cmdlets for the service have the noun prefix 'HLTH' and can be viewed using the command 'Get-AWSCmdletName -Service HLTH'.
  * Get-AWSCmdletName
    - Fixed bug when invoking the cmdlet with no parameters. Instead of outputting the set of all service cmdlets an error 'Value cannot be null' was displayed.

### 3.3.37.0 (2017-01-05)
  * AWS Lambda
    - Updated the Publish-LMFunction and Update-LMFunctionCode with new parameters to support the latest features in these APIs (e.g. environment variable support, VPC configuration etc) and made both cmdlets consistent with support for specifying the function code to upload using an object in an Amazon S3 bucket. The parameter names used in both cmdlets have also been made consistent, with aliases applied for backwards compatibility. Help examples for the two cmdlets have also been added.
  * AWS Marketplace Commerce Analytics
    - Added argument completion support for the new data set disbursed_amount_by_instance_hours, with historical data available starting 2012-09-04. New data is published to this data set every 30 days.
