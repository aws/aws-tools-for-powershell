This allows the automation of cleaning up unused images, for example expiring images based on age or status. A lifecycle policy preview API is provided as well, which allows you to see the impact of a lifecycle policy on an image repository before you execute it.
  * Elastic Load Balancing v2
    * Added cmdlets to support Server Name Indication (SNI). Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension to the TLS protocol by which a client indicates the hostname to connect to at the start of the TLS handshake. The load balancer can present multiple certificates through the same secure listener, which enables it to support multiple secure websites using a single secure listener. Application Load Balancers also support a smart certificate selection algorithm with SNI. If the hostname indicated by a client matches multiple certificates, the load balancer determines the best certificate to use based on multiple factors including the capabilities of the client. The new cmdlets are Add-ELB2ListenerCertificate (AddListenerCertificates API), Get-ELB2ListenerCertificate (DescribeListenerCertificates API) and Remove-ELB2ListenerCertificate (RemoveListenerCertificates API).

  * AWS CloudFormation
    * Added cmdlet Update-CFNTerminationProtection to support the new UpdateTerminationProtection API enabling you to prevent a stack from being accidentally deleted. If you attempt to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the deletion fails and the stack, including its status, remains unchanged. You can also enable termination protection on a stack when you create it using the new -EnableTerminationProtection parameter on the New-CFNStack cmdlet. Termination protection on stacks is disabled by default. After creation, you can set termination protection on a stack whose status is CREATE_COMPLETE, UPDATE_COMPLETE, or UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE.
  * Amazon EC2
    * Added argument completion support for the Attribute parameter of the Edit-EC2ImageAttribute cmdlet, enabling tab completion of the possible attribute names. The service models this parameter as a simple string type, rather than a service enumeration, so tab completion was not available by default.
  * Amazon S3
    * Updated the Copy-S3Object cmdlet to support copying (downloading) multiple objects, identified by common key prefix, to a folder on the local file system. Previously the cmdlet could only process single object download to a file or folder.

### 3.3.96.0 (2017-05-31)
  * All services
    - Cmdlet names for all services have been reviewed and those with plural nouns corrected to be singular to follow best practices. For more details see the blog post 'Updates to AWSPowerShell Cmdlet Names' on the AWS .NET Developer Blog https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/category/net/. A new submodule, loaded automatically, contains backwards-compatible aliases to ensure current scripts will continue to work with the older cmdlet names.
  * Amazon Cloud Directory
    - Added support for Typed Links, enabling customers to create object-to-object relationships that are not hierarchical in nature.

    - Added a new cmdlet, Get-RSClusterCredential, to support the new GetClusterCredentials API.

### 3.3.74.0 (2017-04-07)
  * AWS CloudWatch
    - Updated the Write-CWMetricAlarm cmdlet with support for new alarm configurations for missing data treatment and percentile metrics. Missing data can now be treated as alarm threshold breached, alarm threshold not breached, maintain alarm state and the current default treatment. Percentile metric alarms are for alarms that can trigger unnecessarily if the percentile is calculated from a small number of samples. The new rule can treat percentiles with low sample counts as same as missing data. If the first rule is enabled, the same treatment will be applied when an alarm encounters a percentile with low sample counts.
  * Amazon ElastiCacheElastiCache
    - Added support for testing the Elasticache Multi-AZ feature with Automatic Failover. This support includes a new parameter, -NodeGroupId, for the Edit-ECReplicationGroup cmdlet and -ShowCacheClustersNotInReplicationGroup added to Get-ECCacheCluster and a new cmdlet, Test-ECFailover (TestFailover API).
  * Amazon Lex
    - Added a new cmdlet, Send-LEXContent, to support the new PostContent API.

### 3.3.71.0 (2017-03-31)
  * AWS Resource Groups Tagging API
    - Added support for the new Resource Groups Tagging API service. Cmdlets for the service have the noun prefix 'RGT' and can be listed using the command 'Get-AWSCmdletName -Service RGT': Add-RGTResourceTag (TagResources API), Get-RGTResource (GetResources API), Get-RGTTagKey (GetTagKeys API), Get-RGTTagValue (GetTagValues API) and Remove-RGTResourceTag (UntagResources API).

### 3.3.69.0 (2017-03-29)
  * AWS Batch
    - Added parameters to support specifying retry strategy for the Register-BATJobDefinition and Submit-BATJob cmdlets. The parameter, -RetryStrategy_Attempt, accepts a numeric value for attempts. This is the number of non successful executions before a job is considered FAILED. In addition, the JobDetail object returned by other cmdlets now has an attempts field and shows all execution attempts.
  * Amazon EC2
    - Added support for tagging Amazon EC2 Instances and Amazon EBS Volumes at the time of their creation with the addition of a parameter, -TagSpecification, to the New-EC2Volume and New-EC2Instance cmdlets. By tagging resources at the time of creation, you can eliminate the need to run custom tagging scripts after resource creation. In addition, you can now set resource-level permissions on the CreateVolume, CreateTags, DeleteTags, and the RunInstances APIs. This allows you to implement stronger security policies by giving you more granular control over which users and groups have access to these APIs. You can also enforce the use of tagging and control what tag keys and values are set on your resources. When you combine tag usage and resource-level IAM policies together, you can ensure your instances and volumes are properly secured upon creation and achieve more accurate cost allocation reporting. These new features are provided at no additional cost.
  * Added the legacy alias Get-SSMParameterNameList (an alias for Get-SSMParameterValue) to the AliasesToExport collection in the module manifest so that the alias is available without needing to explicitly import the module.

### 3.3.67.0 (2017-03-24)
  * AWS Application Discovery Service

  * Amazon Pinpoint
    - Added cmdlets Get-PINEventStream (GetEventStream API), Remove-PINEventStream (DeleteEventStream API) and Write-PINEventStream (PutEventStream API) to support publishing of raw app analytics and campaign events data as events streams to Kinesis and Kinesis Firehose. The Update-PINSegment and New-PINSegment cmdlets were updated with a new parameter, -Dimensions_UserAttribute, to support the ability to segment endpoints by user attributes in addition to endpoint attributes.
  * All cmdlet names are now enumerated into the module manifest enabling tab-completion of command names without needing to explicitly import the module into the environment.

### 3.3.64.2 (2017-03-17)
  * Fixed issue with Initialize-AWSDefaults reporting 'source profile not found' error when run to load credentials from the 'default' profile.

### 3.3.64.1 (2017-03-15)
  * Added support for reading and writing credential profiles to both the AWS .NET SDK encrypted credential store and the shared credential store used by other AWS SDKs and tools. Previously credentials could only be read from both stores, and written to only the SDK's encrypted store.
  * Added support for new credential profile types supporting cross-account IAM roles (aka 'assume role' profiles) and credentials requiring use of an MFA. For more details on the updated credential support see the blog post announcing the update at https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-sdk-dot-net-credential-profiles/ and the credential setup topics in the user guide at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-getting-started.html.
  * AWS Device Farm
    - Added support for network shaping. Network shaping allows users to simulate network connections and conditions while testing their Android, iOS, and web apps with AWS Device Farm. The update includes new cmdlets Get-DFNetworkProfile (GetNetworkProfile API), Get-DFNetworkProfileList (ListNetworkProfiles API), New-DFNetworkProfile (CreateNetworkProfile API), Remove-DFNetworkProfile (DeleteNetworkProfile API) and Update-DFNetworkProfile (UpdateNetworkProfile API).

### 3.3.62.0 (2017-03-13)
  * Fixed issue with Set-AWSSamlRoleProfile incorrectly formatting user identities specified in email format. The identity was being stored in the role profile with as \email@domain.com (domain\userid format) but with empty domain. The leading \ then had to be removed by the user each time a password demand was issued.
  * Amazon Relation Database Service
    - Updated the Copy-RDSDBClusterSnapshot and New-RDSDBCluster cmdlets to add support for using encrypted clusters as cross-region replication masters and encrypted cross region copy of Aurora cluster snapshots.
  * Amazon Simple Systems Management
    - Added help examples for all SSM cmdlets.
  * Amazon WorkDocs
    - Added support for the Amazon WorkDocs service. The Amazon WorkDocs SDK provides full administrator level access to WorkDocs site resources, allowing developers to integrate their applications to manage WorkDocs users, content and permissions programmatically.

  * AWS Organizations
    - *Breaking Change*
    Updated cmdlets to fix an issue with the wrong service model version being used. This may be a breaking change for some users. The Enable-ORGFullControl cmdlet has been removed, and the Enable-ORGAllFeatures cmdlet added in the corrected.
  * Amazon Cloud Directory
    - Added a new cmdlet, Get-CDIRObjectParentPath, to enable retrieval of all available parent paths for any type of object (a node, leaf node, policy node, and index node) in a hierarchy.
  * Amazon API Gateway
    - Updated the New-AGDomainName cmdlet to add support for ACM certificates on custom domain names. Both Amazon-issued certificates and uploaded third-part certificates are supported.

### 3.3.58.0 (2017-03-06)
  * Amazon EC2
    - Added two new keys, WINDOWS_2016_CORE and WINDOWS_2012R2_CORE, to the Get-EC2ImageByName cmdlet, to support retrieving the latest Windows Server 2016 Core and Windows Server 2012R2 Core AMIs.
  * AWS OpsWorks
    - OpsWorks for Chef Automate has added a new field "AssociatePublicIpAddress" to the New-OWCMServer cmdlet, "CloudFormationStackArn" to the Server model and "TERMINATED" server state.

### 3.3.57.0 (2017-02-27)
  * AWS Organizations
    - Added support for the new AWS Organizations service. AWS Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple AWS accounts into an organization and centrally manage your accounts and their resources. Cmdlets for this service have the noun prefix ORG and can be listed using the command Get-AWSCmdletName -Service ORG.
  * Amazon MTurk Service
    - Added support for Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a web service that provides an on-demand, scalable, human workforce to complete jobs that humans can do better than computers, for example, recognizing objects in photos. Cmdlets for this service have the noun prefix MTR and can be listed using the command Get-AWSCmdletName -Service MTR.
  * Amazon Elasticsearch
    - Added three cmdlets to support new APIs for exposing limits imposed by Elasticsearch. The new cmdlets are Get-ESInstanceTypeLimit (DescribeElasticsearchInstanceTypeLimits API), Get-ESInstanceTypeList (ListElasticsearchInstanceTypes API) and Get-ESVersionList (ListElasticsearchVersions API).
  * Amazon DynamoDB
    - Added two new cmdlets to support the new 'Time to Live' APIs. The new cmdlets are Get-DDBTimeToLive (DescribeTimeToLive API) and Update-DDBTimeToLive (UpdateTimeToLive API).

### 3.3.56.0 (2017-02-23)
  * Fixed issue with the Set-AWSSamlRoleProfile cmdlet reporting a null reference exception.
  * (NetCore module only) Fixed issue with cmdlet help not being available due to a misnamed help file.
  * Amazon EC2
    - Added -InstanceType completion support for the new I3 instance type.

### 3.3.55.0 (2017-02-22)
  * Amazon EC2
    - Updated the Register-EC2Image cmdlet with a new parameter, -BillingProduct.
  * Amazon GameLift
    - Added cmdlet support for the new service feature enabling developers to configure global queues for creating GameSessions and to allow PlayerData on PlayerSessions to store player-specific data.
  * AWS Elastic Beanstalk
    - Added support for creating and managing custom platforms with environments.
    - *Breaking Change*
      The update for custom platform support changed the service response data for the DescribeConfigurationOptions API (Get-EBConfigurationOption cmdlet) to include an additional field, PlatformArn. Previously the cmdlet was able to pipe the configuration options collection to the pipeline. In this release the output from the cmdlet has changed so that the entire service response data (Amazon.ElasticBeanstalk.Model.DescribeConfigurationOptionsResponse) is emitted to the pipeline, not the collection of configuration options. To obtain the previous behavior, add a select clause to your code, for example: 'Get-EBConfigurationOption ...parameters... | select -expandproperty Options | ...'.

### 3.3.53.1 (2017-02-20)
  * Fixed bug in Get-AWSCredentials. When the -ListProfiles switch was used the collection of profile names was not correctly enumerated to the pipeline.

### 3.3.53.0 (2017-02-17)
  * AWS Direct Connect
    - Added cmdlet support for the new ability for Direct Connect customers to take advantage of Link Aggregation (LAG). This allows you to bundle many individual physical interfaces into a single logical interface, referred to as a LAG. This makes administration much simpler as the majority of configuration is done on the LAG while you are free to add or remove physical interfaces from the bundle as bandwidth demand increases or decreases. A concrete example of the simplification added by LAG is that customers need only a single BGP session as opposed to one session per physical connection.

### 3.3.52.0 (2017-02-16)
  * This version was only distributed in the downloadable AWS Tools for Windows msi installer.
  * AWS Config
    - Updated the Write-CFGEvaluations cmdlet with a new parameter, -TestMode. Set the TestMode parameter to true in your custom rule to verify whether your AWS Lambda function will deliver evaluation results to AWS Config. No updates occur to your existing evaluations, and evaluation results are not sent to AWS Config.

### 3.3.51.0 (2017-02-15)
  * Amazon EC2
    - Added cmdlet support for the new Modify Volumes APIs. This includes two new cmdlets, Edit-EC2Volume (ModifyVolume API) and Get-EC2VolumeModification (DescribeVolumesModification API).
  * AWS Key Management Service
    - Added support for the new tagging apis with three new cmdlets: Add-KMSResourceTag (TagResource API), Get-KMSResourceTag (ListResourceTags API) and Remove-KMSResourceTag (UntagResource API). The New-KMSKey cmdlet was also extended to support a -Tag parameter.
  * AWS Storage Gateway
    - Updated the New-SGNFSFileShare and Update-SGNFSFileShare cmdlets to support acess to objects in S3 as files on a Network File System (NFS) mount point. Customers can restrict the clients that have read/write access to the gateway by specifying the list of clients as a list of IP addresses or CIDR blocks to the new -ClientList parameter on these cmdlets.

### 3.3.48.0 (2017-02-09)
  * Amazon EC2
    - Fixed issue with the Get-EC2Instance cmdlet not accepting instance IDs that were supplied as PSObject types. The cast to string on the supplied PSObject(s) failed, resulting in the cmdlet listing all instances on output, not the requested instances.
    - Added support for a new feature enabling users to associate an IAM profile with running instances that were not launched with a profile. The new cmdlets are Get-EC2IamInstanceProfileAssociation (DescribeIamInstanceProfileAssociations API), Register-EC2IamInstanceProfile (AssociateIamInstanceProfile API), Set-EC2IamInstanceProfileAssociation (ReplaceIamInstanceProfileAssociation API) and Unregister-EC2IamInstanceProfileAssociation (DisassociateIamInstanceProfileAssociation API).

### 3.3.47.0
  * This build was not released.

### 3.3.46.0 (2017-02-07)
  * Fixed issue with the Get-AWSCredentials cmdlet reporting a 'could not find part of path' error attempting to access the %userprofile%\.aws folder (default folder of the shared credentials file) when run on systems where the shared credential file was not in use and the folder did not exist. The cmdlet should instead have tested for folder existence and silently skipped over it when not present.
  * Fixed issue with using SAML credential profiles in regions where a region-specific Security Token Service endpoint is required, eg China (Beijing). After successfully authenticating with the ADFS endpoint the tools request temporary credentials from STS and this call was always directed against the global sts.amazonaws.com endpoint, not the regional endpoint, thus failing to obtain credentials. To enable SAML role profiles to specify that a regional endpoint must be used, the Set-AWSSAMLRoleProfile cmdlet has been extended with a new parameter, -STSEndpointRegion, that can be used to specify the region system name (eg -STSEndpointRegion cn-north-1), resulting in the correct STS endpoint being used to obtain credentials.
  * Amazon Lex
    - Added support for the new Amazon Lex service, for building conversational interactions into any application using voice or text. Cmdlets for this service have the noun prefix 'LEX' and can be viewed using the command 'Get-AWSCmdletName -Service LEX'. Currently the service contains a single cmdlet, Send-LEXText, corresponding to the service's PostText API.

### 3.3.45.0 (2017-01-26)
  * Amazon Cloud Directory
    - Added support for the new Amazon Cloud Directory service, a highly scalable, high performance, multi-tenant directory service in the cloud. Its web-based directories make it easy for you to organize and manage application resources such as users, groups, locations, devices, policies, and the rich relationships between them. Cmdlets for this service have the noun prefix 'CDIR' and can be viewed using the command 'Get-AWSCmdletName -Service CDIR'.
  * AWS CodeDeploy
    - Updated cmdlets to support the new service feature enabling blue/green deployments. In a blue/green deployment, the current set of instances in a deployment group is replaced by new instances that have the latest application revision installed on them. After traffic is rerouted behind a load balancer to the replacement instances, the original instances can be terminated automatically or kept running for other uses. In addition to additional parameters on existing cmdlets, two new cmdlets were added: Resume-CDDeployment (ContinueDeployment API) and Skip-CDWaitTimeForInstanceTermination (SkipWaitTimeForInstanceTermination API).
  * Amazon EC2
    - Updated the Request-EC2SpotFleet cmdlet with a new parameter, -SpotFleetRequestConfig_ReplaceUnhealthyInstance, to support instance health check functionality to replace EC2 spot fleet instances with new ones.
  * Amazon Relational Database Service
    - Updated cmdlets to support the new Snapshot Engine version upgrade. This update includes a new cmdlet, Edit-RDSDBSnapshot, mapped to the ModifyDBSnapshot API.

### 3.3.44.0 (2017-01-25)
  * Amazon WorkSpaces
    - *Breaking Change* Fixed issue with incorrect mapping of Stop-WKSWorkspace to the TerminateWorkspaces API, which could cause data loss if termination was not expected. A new cmdlet, Remove-WKSWorkspace, has been added which maps to the TerminateWorkspaces API. Stop-WKSWorkspace has been mapped to the StopWorkspaces API and the existing -Request parameter changed to accept types of Amazon.Workspaces.Model.StopRequest (previously it accepted Amazon.Workspaces.Model.TerminateRequest). For users employing New-Object to construct the parameters, this is a breaking change (customers known to have used this cmdlet in the past few months have been contacted about this change).
    - In addition to introducing a new cmdlet and correcting the mapping we have also taken steps to improve the usability of the cmdlets related to manipulating workspaces (Start-WKSWorkspace, Stop-WKSWorkspace, Remove-WKSWorkspace, Reset-WKSWorkspace and Rebuild-WKSWorkspace). These cmdlets all now support an additional –WorkspaceId parameter. This parameter accepts an array of strings that are the IDs of the workspaces to operate on, improving pipeline usability. Examples have been added to the cmdlet help to show the new simplified usages.
  * Elastic Load Balancing V2
    - Application Load Balancers now support native Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). With this ability, clients can now connect to the Application Load Balancer in a dual-stack mode via either IPv4 or IPv6. The New-ELB2LoadBalancer was extended with a new parameter, -IpAddressType, to support this new feature and one new cmdlet was added, Set-ELB2IpAddressType (SetIpAddressType API).
  * Amazon Relational Database Service

Starting with this release both AWS modules for PowerShell will update in sync with new service releases and service updates. The product version has incremented to 3.3.0.0 to match the underlying product version of the SDK. For more information see the blog post at http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/net/post/Tx3O6TT4NKFM0FU/.
  * Set-AWSCredentials
    - Fixed an issue in the AWSPowerShell.NetCore version of the cmdlet that caused it to not update the credentials file on non-Windows systems.

### 3.1.101.0 (2016-09-15)
  * AWS Lambda
    - Extended the Update-LMFunctionCode cmdlet with a new parameter, -ZipFilename, that enables more a convenient way to specify the code to be updated. The original -ZipFile parameter, of type System.IO.MemoryStream, has been retained for backwards compatibility.
  * Amazon Relational Database Service
    - The Amazon.RDS.Model.DBCluster type in the underlying AWS SDK for .NET SDK has been extended with a new ReaderEndpoint property to support the new Aurora cluster reader end-point feature.

### 3.1.100.0 (2016-09-13)
  * Amazon S3
    - Extended the Amazon.S3.Model.S3Object type in the underlying AWS SDK for .NET with a new member containing the name of the bucket containing the object. This enables improved pipelining of the S3 cmdlets, for example you can now run a pipeline such as 'Get-S3Bucket | ? { $_.BucketName -like '*config*' } | Get-S3Object | ? { $_.Key -like '*.json' } | Read-S3Object -Folder C:\Temp'. Read-S3Object has been updated to accept an S3Object (or S3ObjectVersion) instance to allow for use downloading objects with the -File or -Folder parameters, the other S3 cmdlets will automatically bind BucketName, Key and VersionId parameters (where relevant) from the piped-in object.
  * AWS Service Catalog
    - Updated cmdlets to support the new Access Level Filtering feature.

### 3.1.99.0 (2016-09-08)
  * Amazon CloudFront
    - Updated the New-CFDistribution, New-CFDistributionWithTag and Update-CFDistribution to enable specifying HTTP2 support for distributions (-DistributionConfig_HttpVersion).

### [AWSPowerShell.NetCore] 3.2.8.0-RC (2016-09-08)
  * Updates the service API support in the module cmdlets to match the 3.1.98.0 release of the AWSPowerShell desktop edition.
  * Upgrades the underlying AWS SDK for .NET to the 2.3.8 RC version.

### 3.1.98.0 (2016-09-06)
  * Amazon Relation Database Service
    - Added support for the new DescribeSourceRegions API with new cmdlet Get-RDSSourceRegion. The DescribeSourceRegions API provides a list of all the source region names and endpoints for any region. Source regions are the regions where current region can get a replica or copy a snapshot from.
  * AWS CodePipeline
    -  Incorporated API revisions to correct naming of members in types used in the recently published view changes APIs. Please note these are breaking changes in the model shapes, but do not affect the published parameters of the cmdlets.

### 3.1.97.0 (2016-09-01)
  * Amazon Gamelift
    - Updated the New-GMLBuild cmdlet with a new parameter, -OperatingSystem, enabling customers to now use Linux in addition to Windows EC2 instances.
  * Amazon Cognito Identity Provider
    - Added support for bulk import of users with new cmdlets: Get-CGIPCSVHeader (GetCSVHeader API), Get-CGIPUserImportJob (DescribeUserImportJob API), Get-CGIPUserImportJobList (ListUserImportJobs API), New-CGIPUserImportJob (CreateUserImportJob API), Start-CGIPUserImportJob (StartUserImportJob API) and Stop-CGIPUserImportJob (StopUserImportJob API).
  * AWS Config
    - Updated the argument completer for parameters of type ResourceType to include support for specifying the application load balancer resource type.
  * Amazon Relation Database Service
    - Updates to the model types in the underlying AWS SDK for .NET to enable customers to add options to a RDS option group that are mutually exclusive. To avoid conflict issues while validating the request to add an option to the option group the API response now includes information about options that conflict with each other.

### 3.1.96.0 (2016-08-30)
  * Amazon CloudFront
    - Updated the New-CFDistribution, New-CFDistributionWithTag and Update-CFDistribution cmdlets with parameters to support querystring whitelisting. Customers can now choose to forward certain querystring keys instead of a.) all of them or b.) none of them.
  * Amazon Route53
    - Updated cmdlets to add support for new service features: support for the NAPTR DNS record type and support metric-based health check in ap-south-1 region. In addition a new cmdlet, Test-R53DNSAnswer, was added to support the new TestDNSAnswer API which enables customers to send a test query against a specific name server using spoofed delegation nameserver, resolver, and ECS IPs.
  * AWS CodePipeline
    - CodePipeline has introduced a new feature to return pipeline execution details. Execution details consists of source revisions that are running in the pipeline. Customers will be able to tell what source revisions that are running through the stages in pipeline by fetching execution details of each stage. This support includes a new cmdlet, Get-CPPipelineExecution (GetPipelineExecution API) and updates to the existing Write-CPJobSuccessResult and Write-CPThirdPartyJobSuccessResult cmdlets.

### 3.1.95.0 (2016-08-23)

### [AWSPowerShell.NetCore] 3.2.7.0-Beta (2016-08-23)
  * First release of the AWS Tools for PowerShell Core ("AWSPowerShell.NetCore") module
    - The AWSPowerShell.NetCore module is built on top of the .NET Core version of the AWS SDK for .NET, which is in beta while we finish up testing and port a few more features from the .NET Framework version of the AWS SDK for .NET. Note that updates to this module for new service features may lag a little behind the sister AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell ("AWSPowerShell") module while the .NET Core version of the AWS SDK for .NET is in beta.
    - The services and service APIs supported in this release correspond to the 3.1.94.0 release of the AWSPowerShell module.
    - Installation Note:
      Some users are reporting issues with the Install-Module cmdlet built into PowerShell Core with errors related to semantic versioning (see https://github.com/OneGet/oneget/issues/202). Using the NuGet provider appears to resolve the issue currently. To install using this provider run this command, setting an appropriate destination folder (on Linux for example try -Destination ~/.local/share/powershell/Modules):

        Install-Package -Name AWSPowerShell.NetCore -Source https://www.powershellgallery.com/api/v2/ -ProviderName NuGet -ExcludeVersion -Destination <destination>

  * Unsupported cmdlets in this release
    - As noted in the blog post at http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/net/post/TxTUNCCDVSG05F/Introducing-AWS-Tools-for-PowerShell-Core-Edition there is a high degree of compatibility between the two AWS modules. A small number of cmdlets are not supported in this edition of the tools:
    -- Proxy cmdlets: Set-AWSProxy, Clear-AWSProxy
    -- Logging cmdlets: Add-AWSLoggingListener, Remove-AWSLoggingListener, Set-AWSResponseLogging, Enable-AWSMetricsLogging, Disable-AWSMetricsLogging
    -- SAML federated credentials cmdlets: Set-AWSSamlEndpoint, Set-AWSSamlRoleProfile
    -- Legacy EC2 import cmdlets: Import-EC2Instance, Import-EC2Volume
  * Known issues in this release
    - There are no known issues in this release of the tools.

### 3.1.94.0 (2016-08-18)
  * Amazon WorkSpaces
    - New cmdlets to support the launch and management of WorkSpaces that are paid for and used by the hour. The new cmdlets are Edit-WKSWorkspaceProperty (ModifyWorkspaceProperties API), Get-WKSWorkspacesConnectionStatus (DescribeWorkspacesConnectionStatus API) and Start-WKSWorkspace (StartWorkspaces API).
    NOTE: the new api to stop a workspace (StopWorkspace) is currently NOT supported as it clashes with an existing cmdlet, Stop-WKSWorkspace, which actually maps to the TerminateWorkspaces API. We are investigating correcting this with a new cmdlet, Remove-WKSWorkspace (which will map to TerminateWorkspaces) and updating the existing Stop-WKSWorkspace cmdlet to map to the new StopWorkspaces API. This is of course a breaking change.
  * Amazon EC2
    - Added support for dedicated host reservations with new cmdlets Get-EC2HostReservation (DescribeHostReservations API), Get-EC2HostReservationOffering (DescribeHostReservationOfferings API), Get-EC2HostReservationPurchasePreview (GetHostReservationPurchasePreview API) and New-EC2HostReservation (PurchaseHostReservation API).
  * Amazon S3
    - Added a -StorageClass parameter (type Amazon.S3.StorageClass) to the Copy-S3Object cmdlet. This parameter enables you to set the STANDARD_IA storage class in addition to the existing reduced redundancy and standard classes. The switch parameters used previously to set these classes have been retained for backwards compatibility but we encourage you to update your scripts to use the new parameter so that new classes Amazon S3 may add in future can be easily specified.
  * Fixed an issue in the Set-AWSSamlRoleProfile cmdlet that caused the user name to be stored with an initial \ if a domain name was not present in the supplied network credential. This could occur on systems where the user credential was created using user name in email format.
  * Added support for tab completion of region, credential profile and image keys (Get-EC2ImageByName).

### 3.1.93.0 (2016-08-16)
  * Authenticode signing has now been enabled for the module enabling it to be used in environments that mandate an 'AllSigned' execution policy. The module manifest (.psd1), new argument completion script module (.psm1) and type extension and formats files (.ps1xml) now all contain an Authenticode signature. For more information on execution policies see the Microsoft TechNet article at https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd347641.aspx.
  * Custom argument completers have been added to the module to support service enumeration types in the underlying AWS SDK for .NET. When constructing a command at the console or in the Windows PowerShell ISE (or other PowerShell hosts) you can now access the valid values for an enumeration type using the Tab or Ctrl+Space key sequences. The ISE will automatically display the possible completions. For more information on this enhancement see the blog post "Argument Completion in Windows PowerShell" on the AWS .NET Development Blog, http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/net/.
  * Amazon API Gateway
    - Added cmdlets to support the new usage plan APIs. Usage plans allows you to easily manage and monetize your APIs for your API-based business.
    - [Breaking Change] The response data returned to the Get-AGApiKeyList cmdlet (GetApiKeys API) now contains a collection of warning messages for warnings logged during the import of API keys. This is incompatible with automatic pagination and therefore automatic pagination has been disabled for this cmdlet.

### 3.1.92.0 (2016-08-11)
  * Amazon Import/Export Snowball
    - Added cmdlets to support the new Import/Export Snowball service. The API for this service enables a customer to create and manage Snowball jobs without needing to use the AWS Console. The cmdlets for this service have the prefix 'SNOW' applied to the noun portion of the cmdlet name. The cmdlets and the service APIs they map to can be listed with the command 'Get-AWSCmdletName -Service "SNOW"'.
  * Amazon Kinesis Analytics
    - Added cmdlets to support the new Amazon Kinesis Analytics service, a fully managed service for continuously querying streaming data using standard SQL. With Kinesis Analytics, you can write standard SQL queries on streaming data and gain actionable insights in real-time, without having to learn any new programming skills. The service allows you to build applications that continuously read data from streaming data sources, process that data using standard SQL, and send the processed data to up to four destinations of your choice. Kinesis Analytics enables you to generate time-series analytics, feed a real-time dashboard, create real-time alarms and notifications, and much more. The cmdlets for this service have the prefix 'KINA' applied to the noun portion of the cmdlet name. The cmdlets and the service APIs they map to can be listed with the command 'Get-AWSCmdletName -Service "KINA"'.
  * Elastic Load Balancing V2
    - Added cmdlets to support the new V2 API for Elastic Load Balancing. The cmdlets for this service have the prefix 'ELB2' applied to the noun portion of the cmdlet name. The cmdlets and the service APIs they map to can be listed with the command 'Get-AWSCmdletName -Service "ELB2"'.
  * Auto Scaling
    - Added cmdlets to support the launch of the new V2 API for Elastic Load Balancing. The new cmdlets are Add-ASLoadBalancerTargetGroup (AttachLoadBalancerTargetGroups API), Dismount-ASLoadBalancerTargetGroup (DetachLoadBalancerTargetGroups API) and Get-ASLoadBalancerTargetGroup (DescribeLoadBalancerTargetGroups API).
  * AWS Key Management.
    - Added new cmdlets to support new import key features. This new support enables you to import keys from your own key management infrastructure to KMS for greater control over generation and storage of keys and meeting compliance requirements of sensitive workloads. The new cmdlets are Import-KMSKeyMaterial (ImportKeyMaterial API), Get-KMSParametersForImport (GetParametersForImport API) and Remove-KMSImportedKeyMaterial (DeleteImportedKeyMaterial API).
  * Amazon S3
    - Added support for dualstack (Ipv6) endpoints. All S3 cmdlets have been extended with a new -UseDualstackEndpoint switch parameter. If set, this parameter will cause the cmdlet to use the dualstack endpoint for the specified region. Note that not all regions support dualstack endpoints. You should consult S3 documentation to verify that a dualstack endpoint is available in the region you wish to use before specifying this switch.

### 3.1.91.0 (2016-08-09)
  * Amazon CloudFront
    - Added cmdlets to support tagging for Web and Streaming distributions. Tags make it easier for you to allocate costs and optimize spending by categorizing and grouping AWS resources.

  * Amazon Security Token Service (STS) and Identity and Access Management (IAM) Service
    - Corrected potential performance issue caused in the previous release by the automatic detection of region from EC2 instance metadata. If no region data was available locally (from parameter, shell variable or environment variable) the cmdlets could attempt to access metadata even when not running on an EC2 instance.
  * Amazon EC2
    - API update to the Request-EC2SpotFleet (RequestSpotFleet API) and Get-EC2SpotFleetRequest (DescribeSpotFleetRequests API). The RequestSpotFleet API can now indicate whether a Spot fleet will only 'request' the target capacity or also attempt to 'maintain' it. When you want to 'maintain' a certain target capacity, Spot fleet will place the required bids to meet this target capacity, and enable you to automatically replenish any interrupted instances. When you simply 'request' a certain target capacity, Spot fleet will only place the required bids but will not attempt to replenish Spot instances if capacity is diminished, nor will it submit bids in alternative Spot pools if capacity is not available. By default, the API is set to 'maintain'. The DescribeSpotFleetRequests API now returns two new parameters: the 'fulfilledCapacity' of a Spot fleet to indicate the capacity that has been successfully launched, and the 'type' parameter to indicate whether the fleet is meant to 'request' or 'maintain' capacity.

### 3.1.73.0 (2016-05-26)
  * Amazon EC2
    - Added a new cmdlet, Remove-EC2Instance (TerminateInstances API) following user suggestion. The existing -Terminate switch is still present on Stop-EC2Instance but is considered deprecated.
    - Added a new cmdlet, Get-EC2InstanceMetadata, to return instance metadata when running on EC2 instances. For more information see the blog post at http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/net/.
  * Added support for specifying AWS access key, secret key and session token values from environment variables. For more information see the blog post at http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/net/.
  * Added support for auto-detecting AWS region using instance metadata when cmdlets are run on EC2 instances. The Initialize-AWSDefaults cmdlets no longer prompts for region selection when run in this scenario. To set a region different to that in which the instance is running, specify the -Region parameter.

### 3.1.72.0 (2016-05-24)
  * Amazon EC2
    - Added the new cmdlet Get-EC2ConsoleSnapshot to support the new GetConsoleSnapshot API.
  * Amazon RDS

### 3.1.71.0 (2016-05-19)
  * AWS Application Discovery Service [Breaking Change]
    - The initial release for this service used an incorrect service model. The corrections involve two new new cmdlets, Get-ADSConfiguration (DescribeConfigurations API) and Get-ADSExportConfigurationsId (ExportConfigurations API). The existing Get-ADSExportConfiguration has been remapped to the correct DescribeExportConfigurations API.
  * Amazon ECS
    - Updated the ECSTaskDefinitionFamilies cmdlet to add a new Status parameter. This enables filtering on active, inactive, or all task definition families.

### 3.1.70.0 (2016-05-18)
