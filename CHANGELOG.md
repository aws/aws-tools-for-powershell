### 3.1.0.0 (2015-07-28)
* The AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell have been updated to use the new version 3 of the AWS SDK for .NET. The version numbers for AWS SDK for .NET and AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell are kept in sync which is the reason for this major version bump to 3.1. There are otherwise no major changes to AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell.
