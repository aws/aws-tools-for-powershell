                        multiple collections of objects, use this attribute.
                        These operations will not then have automatic iteration 
                        code generated and the user will need to control paging 
                        operations themselves. The attribute value is a ;-delimited 
                        set of method (operation) names.

  <!-- ServiceOperations contains the set of api operations for the service, each
       described in a <ServiceOperation> element. PLEASE keep this collection in
       alphabetical order as it makes updating/spotting errors much easier!
       
       Each <ServiceOperation> can take a number of attributes:
       
       MethodName
          This is the name of the method in the service interface
          
       Exclude
          Set Exclude="True" to stop the generator producing a cmdlet for the method
          name. Use this when the method is handled with a hand-written cmdlet (which
          should be placed in the./Advanced subfolder for the service)

      Output
          The tells the generator how to process the response/result object once it
          has disregarded the 'metadata' properties declared earlier.
          
          Some method calls return no usable output in these objects; in these
          cases specify 'Output="Void"'.
          
          Method calls that return multiple fields in the response/result
          should have a value of 'Output="Response"'. This will cause the response
          or result object to be emitted as the cmdlet output.
          
          For method calls that return a single logical result, you do not specify
          an Output setting as this behavior is expected by default. In this case,
          the cmdlet will output the single logical result value to the pipeline.
          
          Upon analysis of the response/result objects, if the number of usable
          result fields does not match the Output mode, an error is thrown by
          the generator as this may indicate a breaking change and needs investigation.
       
       PositionalParameter
       PipelineParameter
          The name of the parameter that should be attributed with 'pipeline-by-value',
          i.e. any data piped into the cmdlet will be bound to this parameter by the
          shell. If the name exists in the service-global pipelineparameter element,
          you don't need it here.
          
       Verb
          Custom verb to apply (this should still be a valid PowerShell verb!)
          
       Noun
          Custom noun to apply for the operation.
           
       ShouldProcessTarget
          If the cmdlet creates, deletes or updates something we need to be able to
          prompt for confirmation depending on shell settings. By default the generator 
          will attempt to use the pipeline parameter but if this isn't available for the
          cmdlet, or the cmdlet has multiple parameters, you need to set this to the name
          of the parameter to use.
           
       NoPipelineParameter
          Set this to "true" to turn off pipeline-by-value attribution for the operation.
          
       
       In addition you can add a couple of child elements to a <ServiceOperation> element
       to rename parameters and add parameter aliases, as follows.
       
      <ParameterRenames>
        <Map From="Region" To="StackRegion" />
      </ParameterRenames>
       
      <ParameterAliases>
        <Map From="ProvisionedThroughput_ReadCapacityUnits" To="ReadCapacity" />
