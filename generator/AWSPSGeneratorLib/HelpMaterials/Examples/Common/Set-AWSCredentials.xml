    <code>Set-AWSCredentials -ProfileName myCredentials</code>
    <description>Loads the credentials contained in the specified profile and sets them active for all cmdlets in the current shell (t)he parameter name can be omitted for brevity). The cmdlet first searches the credential file shared with the AWS SDK for .NET and AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio. If this file does not contain a matching profile the cmdlet will attempt to load the profile from the text-format credential file shared with the AWS CLI. If this file has been renamed, or does not exist in the default location (), use the -ProfilesLocation parameter to point to the credential file. Note that -ProfilesLocation is only used to reference credential files shared with the AWS CLI that do not have the default name or location/</description>

To update the shell run the cmdlet again specifying the name of the profile (Set-AWSCredentials -ProfileName myCredentials).</description>
