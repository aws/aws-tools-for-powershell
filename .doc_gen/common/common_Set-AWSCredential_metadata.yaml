        - description: '<emphasis role="bold">Example 1: Loads the credentials contained in the specified profile and sets them active for all cmdlets in the current shell (the parameter name can be omitted for brevity). The cmdlet first searches the encrypted credential file shared with the AWS SDK for .NET and AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio. If this file does not contain a matching profile the cmdlet will attempt to load the profile from the text-format credential file shared with the AWS CLI, looking in its default location (%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials). If this file has been renamed, or does not exist in the default location, use the -ProfileLocation parameter to point to the credential file. Note that using -ProfileLocation disables profile lookup in the encrypted .NET store file.</emphasis>'

        - description: "<emphasis role=\"bold\">Example 2: Saves the specified credentials as a profile named 'myCredentials'. The cmdlet does not affect any credentials currently set as active in the shell. To update the shell run the cmdlet again specifying the name of the profile (Set-AWSCredential -ProfileName myCredentials). On platforms that support the encrypted credential file the profile is written to the encrypted store. If the platform does not support the encrypted store (Linux, MacOS, Windows Nano Server) the profile is written to the plain text ini-format shared credential file at %HOME%\\.aws\\credentials. To force the profile to be written to the shared credential file on systems that support both stores, specify the path and filename of the credential file using the -ProfileLocation parameter.</emphasis>"

        - description: '<emphasis role="bold">Example 5: Loads the specifed SAML federated credential profile (created with Set-AWSSAMLRoleProfile). The -NetworkCredential parameter is only needed if the logged-in user acount is not joined to the domain used for federation. In this scenario, when temporary credential generated is attempted and the user must be authenticated, caching the identity with the -NetworkCredential parameter value avoids a pop-up credential demand. For systems where the logged-in user account belongs to the domain the logged-in identity is used automatically and no credential demand is made. In this scenario you do not need to supply a credential value.</emphasis>'

When the role profile is loaded for use, the role described in the profile will be assumed and temporary credentials for the role set as active in the shell.</emphasis>'
