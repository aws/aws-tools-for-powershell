            <emphasis role="bold">Example 1: This example creates a new &AWS; Database Migration Service replication task that uses CdcStartTime instead of CdcStartPosition. The MigrationType is set to "full-load-and-cdc", meaning the target table must be empty.
                The new task is tagged with a tag that has a key of Stage and a key value of Test. For more information about the values used by this cmdlet, see Creating a Task (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Tasks.Creating.html) in the &AWS; Database Migration Service User Guide.</emphasis>
