            <emphasis role="bold">Example 2: This example creates and enables a virtual MFA device.  The first command creates the virtual device and returns the device's object representation in the variable <code>$MFADevice</code>. You can use the <code>.Base32StringSeed</code> or <code>QRCodePng</code> properties to configure the user's software application.
            The final command assigns the device to the user <code>David</code>, identifying the device by its serial number. The command also synchronizes the device with &AWS; by including the first two codes in sequence from the virtual MFA device.</emphasis>
